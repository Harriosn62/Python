        "1. Difference Between Interpreted and Compiled Languages\n",
        " - Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) execute code line-by-line at runtime using an interpreter, making debugging easier but potentially slower. Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) translate the entire code into machine code before execution using a compiler, resulting in faster execution but requiring compilation before running.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exception Handling in Python\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python allows the program to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing. It uses try, except, finally, and else blocks to catch and handle exceptions. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          try:\n",
        "              x = 10 / 0\n",
        "          except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "              print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
        "3. Purpose of the finally Block in Exception Handling\n",
        " - The finally block in Python is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It ensures that cleanup tasks (like closing a file or releasing resources) are always performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "          try:\n",
        "              x = 10 / 2\n",
        "          finally:\n",
        "              print(\"Cleanup done\")\n",
        "4. Logging in Python\n",
        " - Logging is used to record events during program execution, making it easier to debug and monitor the program's behavior. The logging module allows setting levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to filter logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "          import logging\n",
        "          logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
        "          logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n",
        "5. Significance of the __del__ Method in Python\n",
        " - The __del__ method is called when an object is deleted or garbage collected. It is useful for cleanup actions like closing file handles or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "          class Example:\n",
        "              def __del__(self):\n",
        "                  print(\"Object deleted\")\n",
        "\n",
        "          obj = Example()\n",
        "          del obj\n",
        "6. Difference Between import and from ... import\n",
        " - import module imports the whole module.\n",
        "\n",
        " - from module import function imports only the specified function or object from the module.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          \n",
        "          import math\n",
        "          print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
        "\n",
        "          from math import sqrt\n",
        "          print(sqrt(16))\n",
        "7. Handling Multiple Exceptions in Python\n",
        " - You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping them in a single block:\n",
        "\n",
        "          try:\n",
        "              x = int(\"abc\")\n",
        "          except ValueError:\n",
        "              print(\"Value Error\")\n",
        "          except TypeError:\n",
        "              print(\"Type Error\")\n",
        "8. Purpose of the with Statement When Handling Files\n",
        " - The with statement automatically closes the file after the block is executed, ensuring that resources are properly released:\n",
        "\n",
        "          with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
        "              content = file.read()\n",
        "9. Difference Between Multithreading and Multiprocessing\n",
        " - Multithreading: Multiple threads within the same process share memory and resources (used for I/O-bound tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently with separate memory (used for CPU-bound tasks).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          import threading, multiprocessing\n",
        "10. Advantages of Using Logging in a Program\n",
        "- Helps in debugging and tracing errors\n",
        "\n",
        " - Provides real-time monitoring of program execution\n",
        " - Customizable log levels for better filtering\n",
        " - Reduces dependency on print statements\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Memory Management in Python\n",
        " - Python uses automatic memory management through garbage collection. It manages object creation and deletion using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Basic Steps in Exception Handling in Python\n",
        " - try – Code that may raise an exception\n",
        " - except – Handle the exception\n",
        " - else – Execute if no exception occurs\n",
        " - finally – Execute cleanup code\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      try:\n",
        "          x = 1 / 0\n",
        "      except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "          print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
        "      finally:\n",
        "          print(\"Cleanup done\")\n",
        "13. Importance of Memory Management in Python\n",
        " - Prevents memory leaks\n",
        " - Improves program efficiency\n",
        " - Ensures optimal resource allocation\n",
        " - Allows handling of large datasets without running out of memory\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Role of try and except in Exception Handling\n",
        "- The try and except blocks are used to handle exceptions in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        " - try block: Contains the code that may raise an exception.\n",
        " - except block: Handles the exception if one is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        x = int(\"abc\")  # Raises ValueError\n",
        "    except ValueError:\n",
        "        print(\"Invalid value\")\n",
        "15. How Python's Garbage Collection System Works\n",
        "- Python’s garbage collector automatically manages memory by:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Using reference counting (when an object's reference count drops to zero, it's deleted).\n",
        " - Using a cyclic garbage collector to handle objects with circular references.\n",
        " - The gc module allows manual garbage collection:\n",
        "        \n",
        "        import gc\n",
        "        gc.collect()\n",
        "16. Purpose of the else Block in Exception Handling\n",
        " - The else block is executed if no exception occurs in the try block. It is used to separate successful code execution from error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      try:\n",
        "          x = 10 / 2\n",
        "      except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "          print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
        "      else:\n",
        "          print(\"Division successful\")\n",
        "17. Common Logging Levels in Python\n",
        "- The logging module defines five logging levels (in increasing order of severity):\n",
        "\n",
        " - DEBUG – Detailed information for diagnosing issues.\n",
        " - INFO – General information about program execution.\n",
        " - WARNING – Indication of a potential issue.\n",
        " - ERROR – An error occurred during execution.\n",
        " - CRITICAL – A serious error that may cause program termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      import logging\n",
        "      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
        "      logging.warning(\"This is a warning\")\n",
        "18. Difference Between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        " - os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current process (used in Unix-based systems).\n",
        "\n",
        " - multiprocessing module creates a separate Python process and allows for cross-platform compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example with multiprocessing:\n",
        "\n",
        "      from multiprocessing import Process\n",
        "\n",
        "      def task():\n",
        "          print(\"Task running\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      p = Process(target=task)\n",
        "      p.start()\n",
        "19. Importance of Closing a File in Python\n",
        "- Closing a file ensures that:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Data is flushed from the buffer to the file.\n",
        " - Resources like memory and file handles are released.\n",
        "Use with statement to close files automatically:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
        "          file.write(\"Hello\")\n",
        "20. Difference Between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        " - file.read() – Reads the entire file as a single string.\n",
        "\n",
        " - file.readline() – Reads only one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
        "          print(file.read())         # Entire file\n",
        "          file.seek(0)\n",
        "          print(file.readline())     # First line only\n",
        "21. Purpose of the logging Module in Python\n",
        "- The logging module is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Record messages for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        " - Save logs to files or display them on the console.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Set log levels and formatting for better readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      import logging\n",
        "      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
        "      logging.info(\"App started\")\n",
        "22. Purpose of the os Module in Python for File Handling\n",
        "- The os module allows interaction with the operating system, including file handling:\n",
        "\n",
        " - os.mkdir() – Create a directory\n",
        " - os.remove() – Delete a file\n",
        " - os.rename() – Rename a file\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      import os\n",
        "      os.mkdir(\"test_dir\")\n",
        "      os.rename(\"test_dir\", \"new_dir\")\n",
        "23. Challenges Associated with Memory Management in Python\n",
        " - Memory Leaks – Holding references to objects longer than needed.\n",
        " - Circular References – Objects referring to each other.\n",
        " - High Memory Consumption – Large objects or excessive use of lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of circular reference:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      class A:\n",
        "          def __init__(self):\n",
        "              self.ref = self\n",
        "\n",
        "      a = A()\n",
        "24. Raising an Exception Manually in Python\n",
        " - You can raise an exception manually using the raise statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "          x = -5\n",
        "          if x < 0:\n",
        "              raise ValueError(\"Negative value not allowed\")\n",
        "25. Importance of Using Multithreading in Certain Applications\n",
        "- Multithreading is useful when:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Performing I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files).\n",
        " - Running background tasks (e.g., monitoring network connections).\n",
