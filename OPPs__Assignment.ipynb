        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which represent real-world entities. OOP allows data and methods to be bundled together within objects, making the code more organized, modular, and reusable. The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation (hiding internal details), inheritance (reusing existing code), polymorphism (using a single interface for different data types), and abstraction (hiding complexity and showing only essential features). OOP promotes code reusability and scalability, making it easier to manage and modify complex software systems.\n"

For example, a Car class might have attributes like color, brand, and model and methods like start() and stop(). A class does not hold any actual data but provides a structure for creating objects. The process of creating an object from a class is called instantiation. Classes allow better organization and reusability of code.\n"

For example, if Car is a class, then a BMW car with a red color is an object. An object holds the actual data and can perform operations defined by its class methods. Objects allow interaction between different parts of a program and help simulate real-world scenarios by grouping related data and functions together.\n"
